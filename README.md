## Data Analytics Projects

### This is a short description of each practical assignment I worked on for the course Data Analytics (INFOB2DA). 
These assignments were carried out in a group of three people to gain practical experience in data analysis to supplement the theoretical knowledge acquired prior. The main topics of the assignments are preprocessing, clustering, classification, and visalisation.

**Practical Assignment 1:**
The main focus of this assignment was preprocessing a dataset through cleaning and normalisation, using feature engineering to perform dimensionality reduction, and rendering basic visualisations to see results.

**Practical Assignment 2:**
This assignment was on applying clustering algorithms (Affinity Propagation, DBSCAN, Birch), evaluation of clustering model performance using various measures, and implementing and comparing several distance functions as parameters for clustering algorithms.

**Practical Assignment 3:**
This assignment was focused on classification, mainly implementing various classification algorithms (KNN, Naive Bayes, Support Vector, Neural Network) and evaluating them.

**Practical Assignment 4:**
In this assignment, we created interactive visualisations and a dashboard to describe US domestic flight data in order to understand effective data visualisation.

If you have any further questions regarding these assignments, please reach Dr. Michael Behrisch (m.behrisch@uu.nl), the lecturer of the course, or Sita Newer (s.newer@uu.nl), the teacher assistant overseeing and grading all assignments.
